#### **Get up and running in ~~seconds~~ a little while**

`create-react-app` can certainly take some time to load in all those packages, so sit tight.

1. `git clone https://github.com/WillTheVideoMan/react-weather.git`
2. `cd react-weather`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
6. _Make it rain._
