### `react-weather`

React component that turns weather data into animations.

Honestly, this was my first project using the React frontend framework. What better way to learn the ins and outs of something than by making the most ~~ridiculously stupid~~ difficult thing possible - animated weather.

I tried to make it as proper as possible. Commented well. Documented well too. No mutation of states. No calculating state from props. No use of `forceUpdate()` or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Just trying to enforce best practices from day 1.

At the moment, the weather details are hard coded. Will be using a proper data souce sooon...

## Usage

1. `git clone https://github.com/WillTheVideoMan/react-weather.git`
2. `cd react-weather`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
6. _Make it rain._

## Docs

This app is bundled with it's own basic documentation server for easier reading and understanding of the project, using `react-styleguidist`.

To run a local instance of this server, run:

1. `npx styleguidist server`
2. Open [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060)
3. _Read cool words._

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
